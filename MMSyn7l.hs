-- A program and a library to modify the amplitude of the sound representations for 
-- the Ukrainian language created by mmsyn7ukr package or somehow otherwise. Besides
-- it can be used to adjust volume for the sequential \"result*.wav\" files.

-- | Function 'changeVolume' is used to change the amplitude of the sound. 
-- For the proper proceeding you specify a @String@, which consists of 4 
-- digits (and it may be preceded by a symbol \"-\"). If the @String@ 
-- begins with the \"-\", then a sound amplitude decreases, otherwise 
-- the amplitude increases. The level of increase / decrease is 
-- determined by the magnitude of the absolute value of integer numbers. 
-- The greater is the number -- the greater is the amplitude change. 
-- The count begins with \"0000\" and ends with \"9999\" (the sign is not 
-- taken into consideration). If there is less than 4 digits in a @String@, 
-- then the @String@ is equivalent to that one with the appropriate number 
-- of zeroes preceding to fulfill to the 4 needed digits (for example, 
-- \"657\" is equivalent to \"0657\", \"-2\" is equivalent to \"-0002\" etc.) 
-- In such a case, for the @String@s without the 
-- initial sign \"-\" (the sound increases) an interval between the 
-- maximum by modulus value of the amlitude (which is represented by the 
-- parts of 1) and 1.0 is divided into 10 equal parts (starting a count 
-- from 0) and then that one of them is selected, which has a number 
-- determined by the first digit in the @String@ writing. Then (if specified 
-- further) the interval between this amplitude value and a value, 
-- which corresponds to the selection on the previous step the next 
-- first digit in the writing (for example, after \"4\" -- \"5\", 
-- after \"7\" -- \"8\" etc.), greater by 1 than the actually selected one, 
-- is also divided again into 10 equal parts and that one is selected, 
-- which corresponds to the number determined by the second digit in the 
-- String writing (again beginning with \"0\" and ending with \"9\") and so on 
-- until the 4th level. The greater exactness is not needed because our 
-- hearing ability hardly distinguish such a subtle sound changes. If 
-- the @String@ has as a first element the \'-\' @Char@ (the sound decreases), 
-- then everything is analogously the same, but an interval between the 
-- maximum by modulus amplitude value and 0.0 is divided into 10 equal parts 
-- and so on. 'Int' parameter is used to control the informational output
-- (to get it, specify 1).
