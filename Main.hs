-- A program and a library to modify the amplitudes of the sound representations for 
-- the Ukrainian language created by mmsyn7ukr package or somehow otherwise. Besides
-- it can be used to adjust volume for the sequential \"result*.wav\" files.

module Main where

import Control.Exception (onException)
import MMSyn7l (changeVolume,adjustVolRes)
import qualified Data.Vector as V
import CaseBi (getBFst')
import System.Environment (getArgs)
import ReplaceP (replaceP, replaceP4)

-- | The main and the only one function in the module. If you specify a one command line argument, which can be obtained by running @mmsyn7s@ program
-- with the needed to be sounded (with sound representations) Ukrainian text (please, refer to: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/mmsyn7s).
